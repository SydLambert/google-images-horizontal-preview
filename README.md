# Google Images Horizontal Preview [BETA]

A browser extension that reverts the vertical Google Images preview panel back to the old horizontal layout.

I made this extension after becoming frustrated that Google changed the Google Images layout without providing an option to go back to the old layout. The way Google Images is structured makes it difficult to create an elegant fix so, **while this extension currently works, it is unfinished and contains visual bugs**.
